Have you ever wished you could be a mild technological nuisance on a budget? Then have we got a deal for you! BangoSkank uses everyone's favorite $2-ish wireless chip, the ESP8266, to flood the area around you with SSIDs of your choosing. Just plug in a battery to your favorite NodeMCU enabled board and you're off to the races!  Features:

* 32 character's per message (but leave room for those random characters!)

* Hardware costs the same as a Cheesy Gordita Crunch Combo Meal! Hide one in your friend's crawlspace!

* Manually crafting SSID broadcast packets means you can send a couple dozen per second! 

* Can run for DAYS on the USB battery you already have!

* .8 MB compile size means you have 3.2 MB (on the average NodeMCU capable device) to fill with political manifestos, links to your mixtape, and ASCII dongs to broadcast to everyone within shouting distance!

* Chock full of bad coding practices!

Don't wait, download now! Operator's are standing by!
